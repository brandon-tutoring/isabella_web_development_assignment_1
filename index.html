				<h1> About My Life </h1>
				<h2> About Me </h2>
				<p> My name is Isabella Schell. I am thirteen years old and I live in Harlem, New York. I live only a few blocks away from Central park so I enjoy going there often to go to the playground and have picnics in the summer and make snowmen and have snowball fights in the winter. I also go to the Metropolitan Museum of Art and The American Museum of Natural History a lot. I am homeschooled so I can travel and I go back and forth from New York to Florida a lot for my parents business. </p>

			<h2> My Favorite Fandoms </h2>
			<p> My two favorite fandoms are: <p>
			<a href="file:///Users/macuser/Desktop/web%20development/isabella_web_development_assignment_1/wings_of_fire.html">Wings of Fire</a>
			<p> and <p>

			<h2> My Hobbies</h2>
			<p> I have many hobbies including rock climbing, reading, learning Greek mythology, and cooking. Since I live in such close proximity to Central Park, I am able to rock climb very often and I have become a pro at getting to the top of a big rock quickly without slipping. I love to read, especially the wings of fire series. I also read classic books as part of my homework, the Iliad and the Odyssey being part of those readings. Reading the Iliad and Odyssey is what got me into greek mythology in the first place. I began to look up questions about the book and soon learned how vast the greek mythology world is. I am a pretty good cook by nature and I often make my family meals, but I am mainly skilled at baking deserts.</p>
			<p> Here are some of my recipes that i have created that are healthy and easily made.</p>
